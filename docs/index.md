<img src = '', style='max-width: 600px;'>

## Greetings

QTLib is a open source project implementing high-level API, written in Python. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. *Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.*

Use qtlib if you need a quant library that:

- Allows for easy and fast prototyping (through user friendliness, modularity, and extensibility).
- Supports both convex optimization and neural networks for NLP, as well as combinations of the two.
- Runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU.

Read the documentation at [qtlib.org](https://qtlib.org).

qtlib is compatible with: __Python 2.7-3.6__.
